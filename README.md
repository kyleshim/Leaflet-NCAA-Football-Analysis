**Project 3 Proposal**

Group One: John Clos, Ashley Gates, KC Oh, Kyle Shimberg

It&#39;s fairly common knowledge that NCAA sports are a lucrative business. In fact, the NCAA reports that in 2019, all NCAA athletic departments generated a revenue of around 10.6 billion dollars (&quot;[https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/research/finances-intercollegiate-athletics](https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/research/finances-intercollegiate-athletics)&quot;), with football being the majority contributor. This data analysis is meant to support business decisions of both leadership within NCAA Football departments and high school football players when faced with recruiting decisions.

The analysis will examine the data through two lenses--that of colleges selecting football recruits that will give them the best chance of NCAA success and football recruits looking at which college to attend that will give the player the best chance of getting drafted into the NFL.

From the college perspective:

- Where are hotspots for recruiting? Where does the best talent come from?
- Are specific areas (states or regions) producing better players for certain positions?
- Which states tend to retain their football talent?

From the recruit perspective:

- How does college impact draft position?
- How does ranking impact draft position?
- How does how far you travel for college impacts draft position?
- How does state impact draft position?

Data source: ​​[https://api.collegefootballdata.com/api/docs/?url=/api-docs.json](https://api.collegefootballdata.com/api/docs/?url=/api-docs.json)

We will pull data (containing thousands of records) from the college football data API, clean it, and store it in an SQL database for further analysis. Our visualizations will include maps with user interaction with potential for other visualizations.

We plan to use the Reveal Javascript library to potentially create our slide deck ([https://revealjs.com/](https://revealjs.com/)). More JS libraries could be added on as we work through our analysis. We will host our visualizations either through Heroku or Git Pages.
